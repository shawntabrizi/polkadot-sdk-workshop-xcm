# Fundamentals

This section of the workshop will teach you the fundamental building blocks of XCM:

- Locations

- Instructions

## Get Started

To run the tests, run `./run_tests.sh`.

The tests are under the `fundamentals` crate, under `fundamentals/src/tests/mod.rs`.

## Next steps

When all tests pass, head over to the `execution` branch:

```bash
git fetch origin execution
git checkout execution
```
