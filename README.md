# Config - Step 0

In this section you'll learn how to configure the AssetTransactor type.

## Get Started

To run the tests, run `run_tests.sh`.

In order to get the tests to pass, you have to complete the TODO in `parachain/src/configs/xcm/asset_transactor.rs`.

## Next steps

Go to the branch `config-1`:

```bash
git fetch origin config-1
git checkout config-1
```
